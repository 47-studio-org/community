albiona
- loved math
- no support
- studied cs
- got into community building via hackathons to have women contribute to open source
- debian contributor came and taught contributing thru github
- saw no skills for presenting at end of hackathon
- so started toastmasters clubs
- no working as devrel
- leveraging engineering as marketing
- ******
- learning along the way
- working on engineering is hard to communicate to people who don't understand
- how to enjoy sharing your knowledge?
- if want community to be integrated, need to know
- want to know...

- how do you share your knowledge
- where
- which content types do you prefer

pooki
- struggling w/ how to share
- conferences help hash out gaps in my own knowledge
- then f2f to learn and share
- not being in hackerspace/meetups are hard

alan
- demos, demoing is the best
- get excited when i build things
- and need to show someone
- words are not as easy as demos
- content type i like is videos
- if not zoom or f2f
- then put it on youtube
- playlist there
- can just point ppl there
- dag house has yt channel for demos
- weekly meeting of just demos
- not a big thing, just small team
- not high intense or pressure
- not done or finished
- encourage that

isabel
- are you finding is ppl w/ web3
- are getting it?
- who isyour current audience
- a: primary is teammates
- discord, can link to it
- not one specific group
- eg one video is Why making coffee and explaining how bitswap works
- boris: +1 on internal demos being shared
- i have a demo on my phone, irrelevant if we don't work there
- ipfs discourse as long form discussion
- 8 discords, 9 slacks and 4 telegrams
- forum doesn't big audience
- post there, and then tweet about it, to increase visibility
- ask demo listener if they'd translate it
- brazilian contributor 
- bring ipfs to others, don't make them come to you
- daniel: meet users where they are
- targeted + short videos
- long talks lose a lot of people
- super targeted at getting something done
- blogs not getting a lot of traffic
- so many channels
- not as many are known
- channels w/o threads are hard
- can't follow
- not a huge fan of chat, even tho convenient
- form has potential for long lived discussion
- lots of pieces in a complex stack
- high bandwidth vs low bandwidth
- twitter is the dht?
- gus: communicating as engineers
- early on, high bandwidth are key
- fast feedback from a person
- more permanent communication makes feedback loop longer and longer
- (b: but only hitting ppl in your timezone)
- trade-offs
- otherwise idea won't get developed
- but missing wider participation early
- public has a lot of noise
- thibault: i read a lot of blogs/forum
- b/c indexed in search engine
- read a lot of blogs of ppl in room
- but eng perspective, fast feedback is great, eg chat
- public vs private is different levels
- advertissement on major channels is good
- ryan: different perspective
- usually i'm the only dev int he room
- i have to give really good stories to communicate what i do
- even the ideas underpinning them
- can't use any technical details w/ my friends
- easy to use sight of that
- have to reach the other 99.9% of the world
- eg who's going to need it most
- composedb - which audience do you fall into
- we don't cater to any of them
- i thought defense industry was acronym overkill... until i got into web3
- *****
- protoschool still best
- stories: how do i get an ipfs?
- *** (video of ppl explaining)
- desktop: still confused
- lidel:
- connect a few threads
- i joined ipfs by sending msgs in a bottle on github
- had a web2 job, ipfs was a hobby
- was asking questions on github
- wanted to make a browser extension
- needed to understand some things
- knowledge gaps in both ways
- no timezone match
- but the team invested time in explaining concepts to me
- returned the favor by not wasting their time
- habit of providing full context
- those threads to this day are linked to
- source of truth
- why decisions were made
- can't link to a chat
- github issues are a discussion forum
- those discussions should be written down in public
- even if starts in a call, needs to get written down
- can't write good specs, if you have single user w/ single use-case
- eg company employees on a slack call
- ipfs as an open protocol and oss project means you have to do that
- i do f2f and ask ppl but at end of day, have to preserve the takeaway
- visibility of decision making is key to satisfaction in community participation
- most of PL is open zoom meetings, calendly meetings, office hours even
- vin: voice is not my ideal
- WEF - connecting knowing things w/ modern tools
- language not so good when talking to engineers
- without a visual to show it
- technology comes from teachings
- self replicating, like how your body works
- become so right brain, forget the roots
- blockchain, games, design, webdev.... philosophy
- metaverse is creating new universe
- not linear thinker, i don't read
- music, programming, art
- what are other ways we can spread the message
- matt: retroactive evaluation
- what has been valuable int he last 12mos
- how to acknowledgeable impact
- what's valuable vs perceived valuable
- optimism / gitcoin
- mechanism to identify impact in the ecosystem
- projects nom'd by community
- projects not otherwise explicitly recognized
- use as an incentive system
- so ppl can take on high impact high risk projects
- and understand there's a way to be rewarded for it
- how to not over-fiancialize
- how to delegate participation, so don't need to weigh in on everything
- 5m break

## group 2

how to bring more people in? feel like they can contribute?

- simple explanations of how and why

- which people? technical non-technical
- be able to communicate the ideas/stories in non-technical ways
- we have to bridge the gap
- need a marketing campaign
- good to see projects focusing on less tech-savvy users
- doing user research - difficult to find users to talk to
- same 25 ppl
- (intro to kelsey, ohioguy)
- place outside the slack/discord
- corp people not going to join the discord
- however ppl discover ipfs, they google it and go to ipfs.io
- doesn't explain how to use it - where it fits in
- missing a shared vision
- no consensys on what ipfs actually is
- causes confusion
- work at the top of the funnel
- communicating what it is, the vision, pragmatic use-cases
- complex stack, get lost
- p2p, content sharing, difficult to understand everything
- re website - did a red hat conf talk o what it is
- eg for 5yo
- anyone can understand, how to explain
- simple animations, etc
- in a minute
- why ipfs matters
- how to explain to ppl after camp
- technologies from the future, which we haven't arrived at yet
- most ppl don't know what decentralized means
- no concept of p2p, blockchain, make no sense
- eg being advocates for creatives
- how to describe such that they understand why it matters
- can show how it benefits their life
- (decentrlized is abstract)
- hard to find out where the community is
- understanding what's going on
- really tough until ipfs camp
- and running a survey
- making the internet better - wtf does that mean
- general users, non technical
- simplify
- show what it can do for them
- a criticism is ipfs is slow
- some understand why and it's fine
- most don't understand though, so has to be clear
- approach adobe or other projects to use ipfs to sync data
- data is deduplicated, and the more ppl sharing, makes it highly available
- do partnerships w/ content platforms
- rpgmaker, unity, ethereal engine

how make contribution feel easier and better
- ppl ask how to get involved
- can do it today - but can't handhold that
- is self-serve, not a path
- could do contributors.ipfs.io
- decision tree of what type of contribution
- eg which project
- contribution map
- contribution pathways
- grants for design research and community research
- didn't realize how much i relied on built-in pathways
- and base level of understanding of open source
- book: design for the real world
- engage design programs in unis
- technical vs non-technical - designers are "technical" but not code
- thinking as ipfs a network, contribut is being on the network
- how to do things so more people can easily participate
- how can we get to people using ipfs without realizing it
- asking ppl "do you have companion installed?" they don't even know sometimes
- fb messenger - just msgs not the tech
- more representative public faces
-  ppl on stage in a funcy way


how to become a truly community-driven? what makes a project that way?
- participation increased when ppl feel like they can influence things
- ppl outside pl have to feel like they can influence the project
- more stakeholders in all aspects
- design, technical, spec, transparency
- rust programming language - but now a community driven project
- created a fdn
- multiple companies
- ipfs fdn?

- something behind other companies being publicly behind it 
- ipfs is approx same age as rust
- ipfs not quite there
- rust addresses problems right now in practical ways
- ipfs is from the future
- doesn't address the present as well
- what kind of organization did a project come from
- if ipfs spun off, would still largely be run by pl
- ppl contributing to project, not pl
- with wider adoption, comes more companies
- community governance is key

# shareback

group 1
- docs
- onboarding was much discussed
- even w/ docs and systems, cahllenges remain
- on both sides
- big gap in group of people in company/project
- in UR, can't be fixed by engineering
- need dedicated reseach team focused

group 2
- ipfs.io
- talks about decentralization but not what it is
- blockchain blah blah
- showcase what ipfs is through simple animations of concepts
- for example, downloads
- what would someone use it for
- what use-cases would someone you know use it for
- integrate into apps that people use and recognize
- understand why people are there
- classify which type of contributor
- governance - maybe a fdn
- more companies interested in investing and participating
- invest heavily in non-software/protocol and invest in design/training

group 3
- key use-cases
- eg turkish wikipedia
- orbit.love
- developer feedback
- eg spec process
- where's the place that says how can i contribute
- sometimes too much feedback, and nobody triaging
- no space where people can submit an idea and see it go through to the in
- community drive
- more than one organization pushes forward and makes decisions

group 4
- python
- no time to give feedback to ipfs
- how to get in touch w/ them
- kubo restarted periodically
- building w/ kubo means restarting it regularly
- how to get issues on the radar
- diversity - overwhelmingly male
- how to welcome and include more people
- huddle, not so structured and formal as zoom
- or a space that ppl can consistently show up
- kubo needs to do what it promises to do
- memleak issue at protocol level
- how to communicate w/ the team
- expectations of what ipfs does are not clear
- eg ask in forum why X isn't working and everyone says "no it's not meant to do that"

ending roundtable comments
- theme: break out of existing audience
- book: traction, cofounder of duckduckgo
- book: social architecture, building online communities - peter hidjens
- positive comment: ipfs is now usable for our communities and 1yr ago it was not
- documentation: education and communication of these concepts - personas, goals
- engineers criticize - how can i make things better, but helpful to know what went right
- some centralization is ok - index nodes changed a lot for better, content loads fast enough that we can actually have users now
- inclusivity: being aware of it
- money: can change behavior, but seems like ipfs community is doing quite well, money funding sustainable growth
- "PRs welcome" how to turn into invitation instead of castigation
- 2018 wrote a course on ipfs - "here's how to try it", but in columbia now there's 3 code schools who want to teach it and dozens of projects who want to use it
- great way to close the conference
- forum post announcing - jump back in
- link in track details
- get @ipfs twitter to share it
