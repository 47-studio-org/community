## Project Name 
‚ÄùJuni::Db"

## Category 
Database

## Project Description
It's a very highload action to store large amounts of data on-chain. The most-common and useful solution for decentralised apps is to use IPFS as a data storage and store on-chain only hashes. Our team, inspired by the OrbitDB, focuses on the scalability, decentralised, easy-learning solution. We work on the development of the configurable database module that allows users to store and manipulate a big amount of data.
### Key advantages
Usability - just integrate and code
Security - built-in encryption
Scaling - ready for changes and big data
### Available storage data types
Key-value - simple key-value storage
Hash - hash storage like Redis hash
## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
IPFS - data storage and database driver
