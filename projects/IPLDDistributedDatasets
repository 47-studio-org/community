IPLD Distributed Datasets

## Category 
Application

## Project Description
This project utilizes IPLD to store datasets in IPFS rather than as flat files. Additionally, it uses IPLD's advanced data layouts to allow lookups by key with a small number of lookups in a decentralized manner.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
This project uses IPFS and IPLD to store and distribute the datasets.

## Project Status
The project is currently in the development phase, but has already been shown to work using a dataset with 100k entries.

## Target Audience
Developers and projects wanting to store static datasets on IPFS while allowing for fast lookups.
