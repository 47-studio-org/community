IPLD Distributed Datasets

## Category 
Developer Tooling

## Project Description
IPLD can be used to store datasets in IPFS rather than as flat files. Additionally, IPLD's advanced data layouts can be used to do lookups by key while fetching only a small number of blocks.

The goal of this project is to provide tooling and libraries to allow developers to store large datasets using IPLD and utilize them in applications.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
This project uses IPFS and IPLD to store and distribute the datasets.

## Project Status
The project is currently in the development phase, but has already been shown to work using a dataset with 100k entries.

## Target Audience
Developers and projects wanting to store static datasets on IPFS that require decentralized, fast lookups.
