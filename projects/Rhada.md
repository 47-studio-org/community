## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
Rhada is building an application to help crypto-native organisations connect payment streams to real world events. We are initially focusing on DAOs looking to provide incentive structures for meaningful participation, by offering a way to start and stop payment streams based on whether members log meaningful activities that further the interests of the DAO.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
Any and all events that are used to modify Rhada streams are publicly auditable in IPFS. We initially used Textile as a publicly accesible, distributed event log that adds full transparency to our application, and allows contributors, investors and partipants to query event logs and ensure pre-event transactions are valid - without requiring expensive on-chain storage.

## Project Status
<!--brainstorming, fundraising, under development, beta, shipped, etc-->
Under active development, from PoC to MVP. Currently seeking further funding.

<!--How can the community contribute to your project?-->
We're looking to canvas from the community at this stage. Contribution could be in the form of feedback on the initial project idea, and in particular we're looking to speak with anyone who has experience in DAO governance and can help guide us on some of the challenges they've been facing.
