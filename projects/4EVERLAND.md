## Project Description
<!--Describe your project in a few sentences. -->
4everland is a Web3.0 cloud computing platform with global acceleration, privacy protection, distributed storage and other technical features.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
<!-- Describe how your project uses any or all of these technologies, and why. -->
**4EVER-STORAGE**: 
A client containing Cluster Service and IPFS nodes, is compatible with the IPFS protocol and automatically forms a cluster of nodes (Swarm) as a result of the Smart Contract modules' node auction. Nodes can synchronize content with each other and persist specific content in storage.

**4EVER-HOSTING**: 
which is a part of 4EVERLAND, helps develpers to automatically build and deploy DApps to to IPFS.Developers can deploy DWeb to the 4EVERLAND gateway through the visual interface (Hosting App) or the command line (@4everland/cli). All nodes in 4EVERLAND can provide persistent storage for the DWeb, and all gateways can provide acceleration for the DWeb.

## Target Audience
<!--Describe who will be your project's users-->
**Developer**
Developers are the core users of 4EVERLAND who use the 4EVERLAND
developer applications, such as publishing DWeb through Hosting App or
publishing content through @4everland/cli, and pay storage and traffic fees
to the network.

**Storage Provider (SP)**
Storage Providers participate in global Swarm construction by deploying
Storage Provider programs; they participate in Storage Provider Auctions
to obtain Storage Provider Slots. If they succeed in the auctions, they can
obtain Storage Provider Slots and enjoy network rewards.

**Gateway Provider (GP)**
The gateway provider provides an access acceleration service for DWeb
by deploying gateway node, and the gateway verifies data integrity and
maintains a secure connection between nodes and clients through an
automatic certificate management mechanism. The gateway provider is
acquired through the same auction process as the storage provider, and
successful bidders are awarded a gateway provider seat and enjoy network
rewards, as well as developer payments for traffic.

**Challenger**
Challenger challenges all Storage Providers to proofs of storage, wait
for feedback from the challenged providers, announce the response of
challenged providers to the community, and propose to punish inactive
providers.

**Token Holder**
Holders can lend tokens to lending contracts for income (the provider
campaigners pay interest to the lending contract). Holders also participate in
DAO governance by holding tokens as proof.

**End-User**
Actual visitors to content in the 4EVERLAND can access the content
published by developers using a domain name in their browser as they would
in a regular Web 2.0 site, or install a Web Plugin to accelerate local network.
It is also possible to use any IPFS gateway to access the content within the
4EVERLAND network.

## Rough estimated user base (if applicable)
