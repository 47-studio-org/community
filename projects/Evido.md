## Project Description
Decentralizing journalism and evidence collection with the power of Inter Planetry File System

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
One of the biggest risks faced by journalists is that their content can be manipulated and controlled by those in high power. Even if they try to publish pieces of evidence through various centralized sources, they are tracked down and suppressed. The truth never sees the light.

We provide a decentralized platform for journalism providing anonymity to journalists who wish to relinquish the true evidences and facts through our 'Evido'.
