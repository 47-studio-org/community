## Project Name
Hub Share                              

## Category 
Application

## Project Description
Hub Share is a secure and decentralized file sharing web application built with JS-IPFS.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
Hub Share stores the files in IPFS and encrypts the link to the file with an cryptographic algorithm. This makes the file storage secured, private and immutable. IPFS plays a major role here as our novelty totally relies on it.

## Project Status
