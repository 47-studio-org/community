## Project Name
PassVault

## Category 
Application

## Project Description
PassVault is a browser extension built with Inter Planetry File System. Users can use their seed phrase to login their account and view their saved credentials. PassVault was built considering security as the #1 priority and is better than most of the traditional password managing methods.

## Use of IPFS, Filecoin and Libp2p
The uniqueness of PassVault is that it uses IPFS for secure and immutable storage of passwords. IPFS adds more value to the password manager by making it decentralized and private.
